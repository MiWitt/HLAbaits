The program baitdesign generates an target sequence tiling (tiling size 1) to design probes for targeted enrichment.

run like: baitdesign probe_length mis_matches ref_seq_fasta scratch existing_probes_fasta

Parameters
 probe_length: length of baits
 mis_matches: number of possible mismatches between reference and bait
 ref_seq_fasta: multiple fasta file with all reference sequences
 scratch: a directory with read/write access
 existing_probes_fasta: a multiple fasta file with all existing bait sequences
