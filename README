The program baitdesign generates an target sequence tiling to design probes for targeted enrichment. If you want to have an existing design for HLA enrichment look into the design folder.

run like: baitdesign probe_length mis_matches tiling_step ref_seq_fasta scratch [existing_probes_fasta]

Parameters
probe_length: define the length of the probes here probes (recommended 120)
mis_matches: for each new fasta sequence all existing probes are aligned to it using blat. Define the number of allowed mismatches here (recommended 5)
tiling_step: for nun overlapping probes set tiling step = probe_length. Set it to probe_length/2 for half overlapping (recommended 60)
ref_seq_fasta: Provide your collection of fasta sequences here. Set the path to a multiple fasta file
scratch: Set the path to a scratch directory where " << basename(argv[0]) << " has read write access
existing_probes_fasta]: Provide a file of already existing probes here. Be aware of the important note below

All output goes to stdout, so redirect the output to your destination file. (e.g. > /foo/bar/my_baits.fa)

IMPORTANT: if you provide an existing probes (baits) file, provide it in following format. First line unique probe name, second line probe sequence, third line unique probe name, etc. NO BLANK LINES, NO REDUNDANT PROBE NAMES.
